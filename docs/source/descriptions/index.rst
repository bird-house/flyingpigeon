Processes
*********

Flyingpigeon provides processes (also named as workflows ) for climate model data analysis, climate impact studies and investigations of extremes. 


Analog pressure pattern
-----------------------


CASTf90 first downloads fields from NCEP reanalysis (sea level pressure, slp, as default) and then searches in a given simulation period for the most similar cases within a given data base period according to a given distance measure. Finally, it writes the N most similar days, including their calculated distances from the reference case, to an output file.


Climate indices
---------------

Climate indices are values that describe the state the climate system for a certain parameter. Climate indices as timeseries can be used to describe or estimate the change in climte over time.

The climate indices processes in flyingpigeon are based on the `python package icclim <http://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
They are subclassed to:

Climate indices have to be calculated for a time aggregation:

.. _subset_countries: 

Subset Countries 
----------------

Generates a polygon subset of input netCDF files.


Based on an ocgis call, several predfined polygons ( world counties ) can be used to generate an appropriate subset of input netCDF files. 
The option 'MOSAIK' as a checkbox allows you to decide, in the case of multiple polygon selection, if the polygons should be stitched together into one polygon (e.g. shape of Germany and France as one polygon) or calculated as separate output files. 

For optimisation of the subset process, the appropriate shapefiles are prepared as follows:

.. _visualisation: 

Visualisation
-------------

Time series visualisation of netCDF files. 
Creates a spaghetti plot and an uncertainty plot.


.. _weatherregimes:

Weather Regimes
---------------

Calculation of weatherregimes based on pressure patterns (kmean method). The processes is performing a pattern clusterfication for observations data ( NCEP ) as well as to model data. both results are compared
 
Method:
.......

* fetching observation data 
* fetching model data
* subset the selected geographical region 
* selection of month to be analyzed
* unit conversion to hPa (if necessary)
* regridding (biliniar) to the grid of observation (if necessary)
* comuting of pricipal componets for dimension reduction

Process Arguments:
..................

* resources (links to netCDF sea surface pressure data) 
* or search with phoenix



Inputs:
.......

* NCEP slp data (automatic fetch)
* any kind of surface pressure data (netCDF files in cf convention). Multiple Datasets slized in seperate files possible

Outputs: 
........

* scatter plot showing the centoides of the clusters and the appropriate centroids of each timestep
* maps for each weather regime of all input datasets. including comparison statistics with observation pattern
* tar archive containing text files with date time , weatherregime table
